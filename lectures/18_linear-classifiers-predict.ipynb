    "2. For linear classifiers, the decision boundary (the boundary dividing the two classes) is a $d-1$-dimensional hyperplane.\n",
    "3. \"Linear classifier\" means directly applying least squares linear regression to problems where the $y_i$ values are either $-1$ or $+1$.\n",
    "4. The coefficients of a linear classifier have a similar interpretation to that of linear regression: if coefficient $j$ is large, that means a change in feature $j$ has a large impact on the prediction.\n",
    "5. In a linear classifier, decreasing the magnitude of all the coefficients leads to predicted probabilities that are closer to 0.5."
